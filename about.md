Ever since we graduated from Stanford in 2010 and took our first bike tour from
Berlin to Amsterdam to Paris, we have dreamed of biking across a continent (or
two).  Despite years of squeezing in adventure to our vacations, our weekends
and even the occasional mid-week overnight, we still craved a bigger adventure
than our 9-5(ish) tech jobs and life in San Francisco would allow.  As soon as
we started dreaming up just what some time off to bike might look like, we each
pushed the vision farther until we settled on the longest mountain range in the
world, something like 18,000 miles.  And we simply couldn’t come up with any
good reason why we shouldn’t do it.

We’ll be departing just before the summer solstice in 2018 in the Arctic Circle
with 24 hours of sunlight and finishing up about a year later with just 7 hours
of sunlight in Tierra del Fuego.

# CAITLIN
Caitlin’s career in clean energy and the environment and her intense athletic
upbringing--crewing her crazy parents’ ultra-marathons and her own track career
at Stanford--have both contributed to unreasonable ideas about what time off
should look like.

# DEVON
Devon’s passion for car-less living and childhood spent backpacking in the
Sierras means he likes to get as far away from another human as possible (with
the exception of Caitlin of course), and he pushed our vision even further, to
be mostly off-road.

Neither of us could find a single other person in the world that would come
along.

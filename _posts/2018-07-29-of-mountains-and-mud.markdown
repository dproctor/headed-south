Is this what riding off-road means?

The mud pulls at my feet and tires, holding me firmly in place despite
Herculean efforts. I push for five wheel rotations at most before the muck
changes to cement that clogs my drivetrain and fork, stopping the wheels from
turning. Pushing, then scraping mud, then pushing, then pulling, then dragging
with wheels not spinning, then carrying, then pulling the bags off and trying
to push again. I try every way of making a bicycle travel forward. Devon
appeared to have been struggling too, but he’s now out of sight beyond the next
bend. Soon, I’m covered in several pounds of the muck myself, searching for
signs ahead of when the road may improve.

Just days ago, I had been strongly anticipating the Great Divide Mountain Bike
Route (GDMBR). Then four weeks into our trip, I was having epiphanies about my
new freedom as I glided gracefully along smooth pavement with views of
turquoise lakes, craggy peaks and glaciers. Free of any obligations, I felt
like my only job was to fully appreciate the beauty of the spectacular places
we labored to travel, and that felt amazing. I anticipated the joy of a new
twist in our adventure with this next section and what new realizations I might
feel.

At this point, we had ridden 2,800 miles from Alaska to Canada, which
culminated in some of the most spectacular scenery yet at Jasper and Banff.
Since the Dalton Highway, we had mostly been riding pretty good pavement, so we
were logging more than 100 miles a day and were well ahead of schedule. After
we turned off the Alaska Highway, our route took us along the Cassiar Highway,
a beautiful, low-traffic road lined with wildflowers and constant views of
mountains, glaciers, lakes and rivers. There were countless bear sightings. My
favorite was the mama bear and cubs that scrambled away through a field of
wildflowers when they heard me coming. One cub climbed up a tree and looked
down at me with pleading eyes. After the Cassiar, we followed the Yellowhead
through beautiful farmland but more traffic, which made us anxious to get to
our off-road route. We enjoyed a farm-to-table supper with a Warmshowers host
and joined them to set up their stand at the farmers’ market the next day.
Fresh vegetables and grass-fed beef felt like a major indulgence after 2,000
miles of truck stop food and backpacking meals. Finishing this first major
section of our journey in Jasper and Banff felt like a celebration as we took
in views of one of the world’s most beautiful places and then indulged in some
rest and relaxation in Canmore.

From Canmore, we took off on the GDMBR and found ourselves in that mud on our
first full day. This off-road route follows the Rockies from Banff to Mexico,
and we intended to mostly follow that to southern Colorado before heading West
towards Baja. All of a sudden as I stood in that mud, Colorado felt like a long
way to bike despite the distance we had already accomplished. We have had so
many beautiful experiences so far on this adventure, but thoughts of
frustration and fear are frequent too.

I remember a tough day on the Dalton Highway when my heart sunk at the sight of
every steep hill. I cursed the rugged landscape; I cursed the builders of that
road; I desperately searched the terrain ahead for a way out of the
relentlessly jagged surface. Most of all, I kept letting myself wonder why I
deserved yet another gigantic, steep hill after scaling so many others on my
worn out legs. Don’t I deserve the progress of a few easy miles?

The next day, I was better fed and caffeinated after making it to one of the
restaurants on the Dalton Highway (the destination I had been pushing so hard
for the day before), and I started off in better spirits. I felt a mental shift
too. I made a conscious decision to expect the hills. I even looked forward to
the feeling of accomplishment of getting over each one. Hadn’t I signed myself
up for an off-road journey through mountains to Argentina? And I had been
cursing hills? All of a sudden, I was climbing hills faster and feeling excited
at the top of each. I was grinning instead of grimacing (at least most of the
time). I felt the same ache in my legs, but it didn’t crush me like it had the
day before. I observed the pain almost like it was a distant feeling, and that
let me push beyond it. It was almost meditative, like observing unwanted
thoughts and pushing them away in the pursuit of a clear mind. I appreciated my
strength; I appreciated the beauty of the road; and I appreciated that someone
chose to labor to build this road through such a rugged landscape. I also
appreciated how much better I felt just by setting the right expectations and
approaching the challenges differently, and I remembered how much control I
have over my enjoyment at every step (or pedal stroke) of this journey.

I’ve been through this mental fight before, sometimes winning and sometimes
losing. It’s only long after my own competitive athletic career had ended that
I have even started to understand it. I’ve been exposed to it though ever since
I was a little kid “crewing” at my parents’ ultra marathons. I think that
exposure is what set the tone for my ability to win that fight. I watched my
parents and other racers stumble, throw up, faint, bleed, crawl and then run
again at mile 90 on an oxygen-deprived mountain trail. Setting that as a normal
thing in a five-year-old’s mind changes how that little kid looks at something
that’s physically challenging. A couple years later, I was running 5K races and
pushing myself to the point of falling over at the finish line as a
seven-year-old. Whatever it was, it was definitely in me too. All the Hewitt
children ended up this way. Ask my little sister Abby about the Ironman she
trained for primarily with barre class. No, this was not a testament to barre
as a miraculous exercise regimen but rather to a Hewitt’s ability to suffer.
It’s certainly not unique to Hewitts, but we’ve had enough exposure to it to
have the confidence to try.

Even understanding what it takes to keep pushing isn’t enough though. It’s a
constant struggle, and one I find I lose most frequently when I’m on the
emotional rollercoaster sparked by the deadly combination of hunger, hills, and
headwind. Most recently, it was the long singletrack section around Fernie,
British Columbia. A beautiful trail, but we might as well have taken the day
off on our pursuit to Argentina, dropped our bags and gone for a mountain bike
ride. The circuitous, needlessly hilly route was painful to follow as I thought
about the easier parallel road we could have zipped through in twenty percent
of the time. But I pushed myself to think about the beauty of the trail, the
fun change of pace of the flowy trail, and to remember that this trail was sort
of a microcosm of our larger adventure. There were an awful lot of ways that
were faster to get to Argentina than the one we chose. Ours was circuitous and
needlessly hilly by choice. Again, why should I expect my trail to be easy?
Where is the adventure and joy of accomplishment in that? There’s nothing like
the feeling of descending in the sunset after summiting a 5,000 foot climb in
the Bitterroot Forest, or having a beer at Fernie Brewing after 10-hours of
muscle-cramping ups-and-downs, or floating in the pool at Triple Creek Ranch
after biking in the 100-degree heat. You simply can’t experience joy on the
same level without the contrast of the challenge, nor can it be an adventure
without the loss of some control.

But don’t let this worry you that we aren’t enjoying any easy, peaceful moments
on this more challenging section. Recently, after a dip in the famously clear
Flathead Lake, we cruised along toward our campsite basking in the warm, rosy
glow of dusk while marveling at a deep red sunset that we enjoyed doubly due to
its perfect reflection in Swan Lake. It’s not the first time on this trip that
I thought I discovered perfect bliss. I think I’m learning to appreciate
fully—and almost equally—the beautiful and the challenging moments on this
adventure.

Today, I turn 30.

While a lot of people start to expand their homes at this milestone, I'll be
shrinking my posessions in favor of expanding my horizons. I take comfort in
the fact that a lot of my favorite things will be put to good use by close
friends for the year (which also helps with storage!)--favorite dresses to my
sister, favorite kitchen appliances to foodie friends, the live edge table I
built to friends with a new home. But really when you get down to thinking
about it, you just don't need that many things to have fun. Having a few long
tours under my belt, I've already learned that less is more and don't expect to
need more for this year-long adventure than what I've carried for a 7-day tour.

So my new home is this beautiful Salsa Cutthroat built up by Bobby Wintle at
[District Bicycles](http://www.districtbicycles.com/) in Oklahoma. Jay
Petervary, a friend of my dad's from the Iditarod Trail Invitational for whom
Salsa designed the Cutthroat, referred me to Bobby to help me craft the perfect
bike for this mega-adventure. Bobby has done the Great Divide Mountain Bike
Route himself on a Salsa Cutthroat and had incredible advice on every detail,
from the spokes down to the pink Sinewave Cycles Beacon that hooks into my
Dynamo generator hub. Thanks, Bobby! Speaking of that hub, I'll be generating
the power for our electronics (navigation, camera, blogging), and I'll be sure
to remind Devon of that when I'm feeling slow.

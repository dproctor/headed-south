Today, we find ourselves at the tippy top of Alaska with nothing but polar
bears and oilmen, and many of you (quite reasonably) want to know why.

Soon[1] we’ll be pedaling along the Dalton Highway with views of snow-covered
mountains, the excitement that accompanies the start of any big adventure and a
bit of fear of bears and cold weather. (I’m looking out the plane window now,
and it looks pretty inhospitable, more snow than we expected this time of
year.) My only purpose will be to get to the next tent site or the next town,
and I’m certain I’ll be counting miles in my head: 500 miles from Fairbanks and
roughly 20,000 miles from the bottom of Argentina.

This literal forward momentum of pedaling south will replace the forward
momentum of a life in San Francisco that has its own rhythm of morning coffee
and smoothie rituals, bike commutes, meeting-filled days in the office, weekend
bike rides in Marin and dinner parties with our lovely view of the San
Francisco skyline. I just turned 30, the sort of milestone that makes you ask
big questions, and it feels like the right time to disrupt that momentum in San
Francisco in favor of a different cadence. A new rhythm of life, scenery,
people and perspectives. My hope is that by making the choice to live
differently this year and exploring many more ways that others live along this
two-continent journey, we will never let ourselves get caught up in just
rolling forward idly through life even at its high points. I have been craving
a big adventure like this for years, and I think what I really seek in an
adventure is that the new challenges, joys, ideas and sources of inspiration
that will push our bodies and test our willpower will also push our character
and test our values.

For those of you who have more questions about how than why (looking at you
bikepackers, backpackers, gear nerds and world travelers), you can see the
details of all that we are carrying below. Start your bets now on what survives
the trip and what we will buy along the way.

[1] Soon should have been yesterday morning, but Alaska Airlines lost our bikes.
After six hours of searching for two giant boxes a person could fit inside that
mysteriously disappeared, they finally located them, and we expect them to
arrive shortly. Fingers crossed they get it right this time, and we should
start by noon today.

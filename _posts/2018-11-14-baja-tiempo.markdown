The old man’s eyes light up with such a force that I think he may leap out
of the rickety chair he was just helped into. “Alaska!” he says in a hushed,
dreamy voice with a huge grin on his sun-worn face. A big grin of
realization comes to my face as well. “Yes, we did bike to Baja California,
Mexico from Alaska!” All 5,500 miles of our indirect and mountainous route
brought us to this old man’s regular desayuneria just south of Tecate.

His excitement sparked something in me that reminded me of a phone call to
my Marnee (that’s what I call my paternal grandmother) before we started
this adventure. When Devon and I told most of the people closest to us about
our plans for this year, we received overwhelming support, but there was
always some hesitation. It tended to relate to practical considerations. Is
it wise to quit a good job with no plans for another one? Is Central America
a safe place to travel—let alone on a bicycle? The last-minute nature seemed
to amplify the concerns. We would leave in less than six weeks. Was
spontaneity a good quality in a decision like this? However, when I called
Marnee, she immediately squealed with excitement. With her immediate,
joyous, unquestioning support, I knew in that moment that I had made the
right choice. Marnee and I have always shared a similar spirit, but I
especially appreciated that her extra sixty years of perspective led her to
know this was the right choice for me. While the old man in the desayuneria
might have spent all of his eighty or so years not far from that very spot,
I saw that twinkle of an adventurer’s spirit in him, and I appreciated his
support too.
